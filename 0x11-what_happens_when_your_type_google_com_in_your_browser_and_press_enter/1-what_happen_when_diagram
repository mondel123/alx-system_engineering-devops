Here's a brief description of each step:

When you type https://www.google.com in your browser, your computer first needs to resolve the domain name "www.google.com" to an IP address. This is done through a DNS resolver, which looks up the IP address associated with the domain name.
Once the IP address is obtained, your computer sends a request to that IP address on the appropriate port (usually port 443 for HTTPS traffic).
The traffic between your computer and the server is encrypted using SSL/TLS to ensure privacy and security.
The traffic goes through a firewall, which is a security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
The request is then distributed among multiple web servers by a load balancer, which helps to distribute the workload evenly among the servers.
The web server that receives the request generates a response by serving a web page. The web page may be static or dynamic (generated on the fly).
If the web page is dynamic, the web server may request data from an application server, which generates the web page based on the request and data from the database.
The application server retrieves the required data from the database and generates a dynamic web page, which is sent back to the web server.
The web server then sends the response back to your computer, which displays the web page in your browser.
